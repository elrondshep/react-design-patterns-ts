# React Design Patterns and Other Things

This is a React app that I've used to practice various design patterns used in React and describe how it's done. I also try to explain how to use them, when to use them, when not to use them, advantages and disadvantages among other things. I've also just threw in other things. It uses TypeScript and sass among other helpful packages and builders.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm run start
   ```

3. Start the app in dev: You can use this when you are messing around with it to test some things out and web pack will keep building when changes are saved.

   ```bash
    npm run start:dev
   ```
